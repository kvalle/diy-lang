## Part 7: using your language

Congratulations! You have now made your own programming language. It's time to take it out for a spin.

Any programming language with respect for itself needs to have a standard library. This is a collection of useful functions provided along with the language core.

In this section we will create various useful functions, all implemented purely in the Lisp. No Python this time!

For this part, you should consider the provided tests more like suggestions than something you *have* to follow. It is your language, after all, and you decide what should be in its library.

```bash
nosetests tests/test_7_using_the_language.py --stop
```

### What's next?

You have created a programming language, *and* used it to write serious code. 
If you'd like to wrap up here, that's perfectly fine, and you should be proud of what you have done.

If, however, you want more, then move on to [part 8](8.md) for the final challenge.
