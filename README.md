## DIY Lisp 

> batteries included, some assembly required

In this tutorial/workshop we'll be implementing our own little language, more or less from scratch. 

By the end of the tutorial you will be the proud author of a programming language, and will hopefully better understand how programming languages work  on a fundamental level.

### What we will be making

We will make a relatively simple, but neat language. We aim for the following features:

- A handful of datatypes (integers, booleans and symbols)
- Variables
- First class functions with lexical scoping
- That nice homemade quality feeling

We will *not* have:

- A proper type system
- Error handling
- Good performance
- And much, much more

The language should be able to interpret the following code by the time we are done:

```lisp
(define fact 
    ;; Factorial function
    (lambda (n) 
        (if (eq n 0) 
            1 ; Factorial of 0 is 1
            (* n (fact (- n 1))))))

;; When parsing the file, the last statement is returned
(fact 5)
```

The syntax is that of the languages in the Lisp family. If you find the example unfamiliar, you might want to have a look at [a more detailed description of the language](parts/language.md).

### Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have installed [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). 
*(You'll want to get Python 2.7, since it [turns out](https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lisp/issues/2) the tutorial doesn't work too well with Python 3.)*

Then install `nose`, the Python test framework we'll be using.

```bash
pip install nose
```

*Optional: If you are familiar with [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) you might want to do this in a separate pyenv.*

Finally, clone this repo, and you're ready to go!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lisp.git
```

> Also, if you're unfamiliar with Python, you might want to have a look at the basics in the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html) before we get going. There is also the small [Python cheat sheet](parts/python.md) to help you along.

### Get started!

The workshop is split up into seven parts. Each consist of an introduction, and a bunch of unit tests which it is your task to make run. When all the tests run, you'll have implemented that part of the language.

Have fun!
